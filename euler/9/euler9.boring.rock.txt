(A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,)
(    a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
(For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.)
(There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.)

onethousand is 1000                        ( // 'a' is a reserved keyword )
aa is 1                                    ( aa = 1                       )
bb is 1                                    ( bb = 1                       )

  if aa of aa plus bb of bb is cc of cc    (   if aa^2 + bb^2 == cc^2     )
    break it down                          (     break                    )

  build bb up                              (   bb++                       )
