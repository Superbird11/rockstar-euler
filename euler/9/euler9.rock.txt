My painting is a flamboyant variegated colorscape
My passion is nothing
Build up my passion
Let my heart be my passion
Until nowhere
Put my painting without my passion without my heart into words
If my passion of my passion plus my heart of my heart is words of words
Break it down

Build my heart up
If words are smaller than my heart (my heart is as big as words)
Build my passion up
Put my passion into my heart


Say words of my heart of my passion
