(The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is)
(    1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385)
(The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is)
(    [1+2+...+10]^2=55^2=3025)
(Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.)
(Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.)

Limit is 100                           ( limit = 100                )
Sum is 0                               ( sum = 0                    )
Squares is 0                           ( squares = 0                )
Index is 1                             ( index = 1                  )
Until index is greater than limit      ( while index <= limit       )
  Let sum be with index                (   sum += index             )
  Let squares be with index of index   (   squares += index * index )
  Build index up                       (   index++                  )

Say sum of sum without squares         ( print{sum * sum - squares} )
