A prayer takes strength and weakness 
Let failure be weakness without weakness
Knock weakness down
Until failure is as great as weakness
Put strength at failure into your memory
Put strength at weakness into mine
If your memory ain't mine               
Give back lies            

Build failure up
Knock weakness down

Let your spirit be right
Give back your spirit


Listen to your heart
Cut your heart into pieces
Let the world be pieces
Whisper a prayer taking your heart, the world
